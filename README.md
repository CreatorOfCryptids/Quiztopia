# Description

// TODO

# How to use:

If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to call `npm start` from the `./quiztopia` directory, and `node index.js` from the `./Server` directory. This should open port 3000 for sending and reciving the client-side information, and port 9000 for sending and reciving server side information.

## Dependencies:

### quiztopia/

We used the default packages provided by `npx create-react-app quiztopia`, as well as Bootstrap (imported with `npm i --save bootstrap`).

### Server/

We used the default packages provided by `npm init`, as well as the Express, Mongoose, NodeMON, dotenv, and cors (imported with the command `npm i --save express mongoose nodemon dotenv cors`).
